In the board list on your home, you can see all boards you have access to:

* the boards you've been invited to;
* the shared boards open the everybody (read only).


When you hover a board, action icons appear.

On the boards you own, you can:

Archive the board:
    The board will not be accessible anymore, but it is not destroyed. You can restore it anytime.

Add members:
    The *add member* icon (pointed by the orange arrow on the screenshot above) allows you to invite members to your board.
    Invited people can already be users of the application, in which case you can find them by username or email, or you can invite
    new people by entering their emails.

Revoke members:
    Click on a member, then on "Remove".

On the boards you are simply a member of, you can opt-out anytime.
