Bug reports
^^^^^^^^^^^

Help us improve Kansha by reporting the bugs or unexpected behaviors you may encounter, by following the steps below.

Can you reproduce the issue?
    Try to reproduce your bug using a recent version of the software, to see whether it has already been fixed. The easiest way to test the latest stable version of Kansha is on the `demo <http://demo.kansha.org>`_.

Has someone else already reported the issue?
    Use the search box on `GitHub Issues`_ to see if your bug has already been reported. If it is the case, you can contribute more information by commenting the issue.

Reporting a new bug.
    If you reproduce the bug and nobody has reported it already, go to `GitHub Issues`_ and there:

    #. Click on the green button "New issue".
    #. You will be asked to log in (or register) if you have not already done so.
    #. As title, enter a  short one-sentence summary that explains the problem, biginning with "[Bug]".
    #. As comment, tell us:

       * The version of the Kansha software on which you raised the bug (visible in the footer of your home page, or of the login page).
       * Steps to reproduce: Easy-to-follow steps that will trigger the described problem. Include any special setup steps.
       * Actual results: What the application did after performing the above steps.
       * Expected results: What the application should have done, if there was no bug.
       * The web browsers or computer systems you've seen the bug on.
       * Whether the problem appears every time, only occasionally, only on certain pages, or only in specific circumstances.

    #. You may also attach a log file or screenshot (but make sure that no confidential data is included or shown).
    #. Submit the issue.


Recommendations:

    * Be precise.
    * Be clear: explain how to reproduce the problem, step by step, so others can reproduce the bug.
    * Include only one problem per report.


Feature requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your are missing some features in Kansha? Fill a feature request!

Make sure the feature does not already exist!
    Have a look at the latest documentation on http://kansha.readthedocs.org/latest/, or play with the latest stable version of Kansha on the `demo <http://demo.kansha.org>`_.

Has someone else already requested the feature?
    Use the search box on `GitHub Issues`_ to see if your feature has already been requested. If it is the case, you can contribute to the user story by commenting the issue.

Requesting a new feature.
    If you are sure the feature does not exist yet, and that nobody has asked for it, go to `GitHub Issues`_ and there:

    #. Click on the green button "New issue".
    #. You will be asked to log in (or register) if you have not already done so.
    #. As title, enter a  short one-sentence summary that explains the expected feature, beginning with "[Feature request]".
    #. As comment, tell us:

       * A description of what you would like to achieve, and why. A `user story <https://help.rallydev.com/writing-great-user-story>`_ is an effective way of conveying this.

    #. Submit the issue.

Contribute to the documention
-----------------------------

We try hard to keep the documentation accurate and up-to-date, and volunteers are welcome.

If you find typos, inaccuracies, mistakes or misleading information;
if you think some features of Kansha deserve more detailled explanations;
if you missed some tricks or tidbitts you learned the hard way later;
please contribute directly to the manual.


.. _direct_doc:

Direct contribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, you'll need to prepare your :ref:`develenv`. Keep the virtual environment activated, or activate it.

Like many other Python projects, we use `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ to write the documentation,
and `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ and `Readthedocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ to format it into HTML pages.

Besides `plain reST <http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html>`_, we also make heavy use of Sphinx extended `directives <http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/index.html>`_.

The source documentation is located in :file:`<KANSHA_DIR>/doc`. To build the html version locally, just type::

    $ cd <KANSHA_DIR>/doc
    $ make html

You will then find the HTML files in :file:`<KANSHA_DIR>/doc/_build/html/`.

Documentation workflow:

1. Redact;
2. check your grammar, spelling and syntax;
3. build the HTML;
4. proofread;
5. repeat from 1. until your text is clear, complete and correct;
6. commit with appropriate message;
7. go to 1 until your work is done;
8. push;
9. submit a pull request on github.

To avoid duplicate work or conflicts, you'd better fill an issue first, to announce what you are going to do , on `GitHub Issues`_. For that, proceed as below :ref:`indirect_doc`, except you don't have to redact your contribution inside the issue. Instead, you assign it to you.


.. _indirect_doc:

Indirect contribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the workflow described above is too complicated for you, there is an alternative, yet much less effective: submit an *enhancement* issue on `GitHub Issues`_ and wait for a volunteer to implement it.

#. Click on the green button "New issue".
#. You will be asked to log in (or register) if you have not already done so.
#. As title, enter a  short one-sentence summary that explains the proposed prose, beginning with "[Docs]".
#. As comment, you:

    * tell us whether you propose a fix or new paragraphs/sections;
    * precise where in the manual you contribution should go;
    * **redact** the part of the manual you want to add or fix.

#. Submit the issue.

And, *maybe*, a direct contributor will discuss, pick and implement your request.

Fix bugs and code new features
------------------------------

You want to actively contribute to the code: welcome aboard!

Pick up (*or fill in*) a bug or a feature request in the `GitHub Issues`_ and let's go!

Preparation
^^^^^^^^^^^

First, check the issue is not already assigned to someone.
If it is free, declare your intentions by posting a comment on the issue.
That will start a discussion with the other developers, who may give you valuable advice.
If you are new to Nagare development, you should choose to fix some bugs first, before implementing new features.
If everything goes well, you'll be assigned to that issue.

If not already done, prepare your :ref:`develenv`. Keep the virtual environment activated, or activate it.

Now you can code. Kansha is developed upon the Nagare Framework. If you are not already familiar with Nagare development, these are useful resources:

* The `Nagare tutorial <http://www.nagare.org/trac/wiki/NagareTutorial>`_.
* The `Nagare documentation <http://www.nagare.org/trac/wiki>`_.
* The `Nagare API <http://www.nagare.org/trac/api>`_.


Guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^

Backend
"""""""

Nagare applications are based on components, so always think *component*.

Components should be reusable. Components should not necessarily match business/domain objects. Components correspond to functional parts of the user interface and business logic. They may use several domain objects. Domain objects must not be aware of components.

As a consequence, the main view of a component should generate one and only one DOM tree (i.e. only one root, usually a ``div``).

Kansha uses semantic HTML5 for the UI. Avoid presentation specific markup and inline styles.

Python code should comply with PEP8. That requirement may be relaxed when it is difficult or impossible to follow, e.g. in views with many context managers (``with … :``).

Since we use service injection, **pass optional parameters to functions/classes as explicit keyword arguments instead of positional arguments**, unless they are services.

If you add new services, provide a mockup version for tests.

Use docstrings and comments to make it easier for other developers to understand your code.

All UI messages and labels should be in UTF8 and marked for localization.

Write unit tests for internal functions, classes and API (we use :program:`nose`).

If you need to update the data schema, use the integrated alembic commands: :command:`kansha-admin alembic-revision [application]`, :command:`kansha-admin alembic-upgrade [application]`…

Frontend
""""""""

The frontend must work on Internet Explorer >=9, Firefox, Chrome and Safari. Test before submitting a Pull Request.

CSS
    Please don't overqualify your selectors! Overqualified selectors are slow, add clutter, are difficult to read and go against component reusability. That rule was not followed in the past and it was a mistake.

    To minimize git merge conflicts and to improve readability, write one property per line, with 4 space indentation (like python code). Selectors are not indented. Always put a space after the colon (:).

    Tools like CSS lint can help.

Javascript
    Most of these `recommendations <http://isobar-idev.github.io/code-standards/#javascript_javascript>`_ apply here as well. Use what is already in place instead of adding new layers of code. Don't do in Javascript what can be done with asynchronous Nagare views. Always favor the Nagare way.

    Tools like jshint or jslint can help.

General
"""""""

If you add a new feature, or if you modify the behavior or UI of an existing feature, please :ref:`update <direct_doc>` the documentation.

Now that the translations are managed by Transifex, the ``.PO`` files must no be edited manually anymore.

Workflow
^^^^^^^^

1. Develop;
2. check your style;
3. update the manual (if new feature, modified UI or behavior);
4. write unit tests for internal funtionality and API (*for the latter, write the tests first, then develop*);
5. test (IE9/Firefox/Chrome/Safari);
6. repeat from 1. until your tests (automatic and/or manual) pass;
7. commit with appropriate message;
8. go to 1 until your work is done;
9. push;
10. submit a pull request on github.


Review Pull Requests
--------------------

An other appreciated contribution is when you review others' pull requests. That' s also an excellent way to socialize and be part of the community.
